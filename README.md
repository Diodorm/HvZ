You are a student on Georgia Tech’s campus. You are the last human survivor of Humans vs Zombies. Your objective in this game is to reach the goal point while killing as many zombies as you can along the way.

Use WASD to move, SPACE to jump, and SHIFT to crouch. Use the MOUSE to throw “socks” at the zombies to kill them. The game will end if your health reaches 0 or once you reach the goal point. If you run out of socks, you can collect more as they appear randomly around campus (they’re the red boxes).
